            players who are involved in the weekly competitions. For the later

            Like a real-life football generates revenue, in-game clubs get
            revenue in form of in-game items for competing weekly. Higher
            divisions and better-performing clubs get better rewards.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most of the rewards are distributed on a weekly basis, but minor
            rewards are also given for each win. Rewards are distributed via
            loot boxes that randomly generate a combination of player cards,
            cosmetic items, and manager cards.

        <div className="pay-to-earn-economy__description">
            To improve the club’s performance, each user can procure better
            player cards or upgrade existing ones. Upgrade items are given from
            the loot boxes and can be used to improve certain stats of a card.
