            Blockchain
        </h2>
        <div className="technology__description">
            We chose onflow for our project because of the opportunities it brings
            to game development. While decentralised and transparent ledgers are
            important to asset the lack of any tampering on our part, onflow additionally
            offers scalability and flexibility for contract building that a vibrant
            football game requires.

            NTF & true ownership
        </h2>
        <div className="technology__description">
            We believe that users should receive a part of the benefits that they
            bring to our projects. This is the reason why we embraced true ownership
            for our in-game items. We expect people to be able to trade their grinding
            time for rare NFTs - to either get paid or advance in-game.
